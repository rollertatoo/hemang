Mention the ethical approval taken from Institutional/National Bioethics committee.</p>
<p id="u6215-112" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>H. Statistics</strong></p>
<p>Describe statistical methods with enough detail to enable a knowledgeable reader with access to the original data to verify the reported results. When possible, quantify findings and present them with appropriate indicators of measurements error or uncertainty (such as confidence intervals). Avoid relying solely on statistical hypothesis testing, such as the use of P values, which fails to convey important quantitative information. Discuss the eligibility of experimental subjects. Give details about randomization. Describe the method for and success of any blinding of observations. Report the complications of treatment. Give numbers of observations. Report the losses to observation (such as dropouts from a clinical trial). References for the design of the study and statistical methods should be to standard works when possible (with pages stated) rather than to papers in which the designs or methods were originally reported. Specify any general computer programs used.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Put a general description of methods in the methods section. When data are summarized in the results section, specify the statistical methods used to analyze them. Restrict tables and figures to those needed to explain the argument of the paper and to assess its support. Use graphs as an alternative to tables with many entries; do not duplicate data in graphs and tables. Avoid non-technical uses of technical terms in statistics, such as "random", (which implies a randomizing device), "normal", "significant", "correlations" and "samples".

Include in discussion section the implications of the findings and their limitations including implications for future research. Relate the observations to other relevant studies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Link the conclusions with the goals of the study but avoid unqualified statements and conclusions not completely supported by data. In particular, authors should avoid making statements on economic benefits and costs unless their manuscript includes economics data and analyses. Avoid claiming priority and alluding to work that has not been completed. State new hypothesis when warranted. But clearly label them such recommendations, when appropriate, may be included.</p>

<p>All submitted illustrations become the property of Pakistan Journal of Medical Research and will not be returned unless the manuscript is rejected.</p>
<p>Legends for Illustrations</p>
<p>Legends for illustrations should be concise and should not repeat the text. Legends should be typed double-spaced on a separate page. Each figure should be cited in consecutive numerical order in the text. Give the figures a number following the word Figure. Use letters to designate parts of illustrations (e g , A,B,C) and describe each part clearly in the legend. Any letter designations or arrows appearing on the illustration should be identified and described fully.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Original (not previously published) illustrations are preferred for publication in the Journal, however, if illustrations have been published previously, authors are responsible for obtaining written permission from the publisher to reprint. The source of the original material must be cited in the references and the following credit line included in the legend. (Reprinted by permission of Ref. X).
